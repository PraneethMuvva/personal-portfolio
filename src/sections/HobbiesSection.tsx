          When I'm not coding or exploring new ML ideas, I stay active through weightlifting, triathlon
          and taekwondo. I love pushing my physical limits, and enjoy hitting the trail with a hike on
          weekends, especially when the views are worth the climb.

          I'm also big on strategy board and card games. Poker is my favorite, bringing out my
          fascination in math, risk management, and game theory, but I'm never one to shy away from
          classics like Risk, Monopoly, and Spades. Some friendly competition tends to bring out the
          best in me.

          As a huge basketball fan, I follow both the NBA and college hoops closely. I've been a
          lifelong Dallas Mavericks supporter and love cheering on the Duke Blue Devils during the
          college season. Whether it's sports, games, or endurance training, I'm drawn to challenges
          that demand focus, strategy, and grit, no matter where I am.
